# segmentation_tutorial

In this tutorial a simple implementation of UNet for medical image segmentation has been shown. 
In the test dataset, there are only 3 images, make sure to update the address in the train file. with only 10 epochs the model with over fit. And one of the images is used for testing.

I found the images in internet. 

Make sure to install the following libraries

segmentation-models 
Keras 2.3.1
Torch 1.8
Tensorflow 2.4
scikit-learn
